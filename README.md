# Computer_Club_JAVA_Project
Hey people! Welcome to the John Cooper School Computer Club Java Project. Here will be the place for the project debriefing, links to videos where we got the idea from and other miscellaneous stuff!
The current project we are working on is: Java Maze Project. See the link here: https://youtu.be/d8rU71OBkxU
After you have download your java IDE (BlueJ recommended), you can create a new project on your computer, make new classes and copy the those code above the page into each corresponding classes. Remember to keep the class name the same as it is in this GitHub page, otherwise something really terrible could happen......
